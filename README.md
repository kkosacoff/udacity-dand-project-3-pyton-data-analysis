# udacity-dand-project-4-eda-python
In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

In the project I:
 - Cover all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
 - Pose questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
 - Investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format I can use
 - Communicate the results of my analysis
 - Use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up data analysis code
 - Use pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let me access data more conveniently
 - Use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings
